            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Veganism is a practice of abstaining from the use or consumption of animal products.
                 Such practices are occasionally seen in philosophical religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. 
                 Many non religious and people who practice different religions are seen practicing the vegan lifestyle as well.
                Veganism is becoming more abundant and more and more people are being more open to giving it a try.
                My hopes are that with this informative website I could give the information and answer the questions of those who are indeed planning on embarking on this journey.

            <h3>Personal Experience</h3>
            <p>When Covid-19 just hit during the March of 2021 I was looking for ways to better myself. 
                I tried out meditating, reading, etc. Then I stumbled upon veganism and I was curious because I was also looking for ways to get in shape. 
                I saw veganism as a diet that could help me get fit. In order to stick to it I began doing research and found out all of the cruelty in the animal industry. 
                The horrors those poor animals had to go through. The effects of it on the environment. Slowly but surely veganism became much more than a diet to me.
                 I chose to stay vegan no matter what. My reasons now were much stronger than before and the passion I felt towards the subject of animal welfare and environment were immense.
                  When I found out all the lies that were being fed to me all through my life, I knew I had to let the rest of the world know too.

                <h3 class="titleText">What does the diet consist of?</h3>
                <p>A vegan diet is a plant based diet meaning that you abstain from any and all animal products. 
                    That includes products like gelatin. 
                    Also products made by animals for animals like honey and milk. 
                    Basically food or products that isn't produced by an animal or isn’t the animal is considered vegan.
                     No, it is not just lettuce.
                </p>
<br><br>
                <h3 class="titleText">“But what about protein bro? B-12 bro?”</h3>
                <p>Any diet that is unbalanced is a bad diet. Let it be vegan or not. Humans and other animals don’t need one specific food group, we need the nutrients from it.
                     Many people are concerned that they might not get all of the vitamins they need if they turn to a plant based diet, but as long as it is a balanced diet any deficiencies shouldn’t be a problem. 
                     If one does become deficient in something, vegan vitamins are always an option. In fact, the majority of Americans already suffer from vitamin deficiencies as well as <a style="color: #7fcc2b" href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/micronutrient-inadequacies/overview">health problems</a> such as diabetes, obesity, etc. 
                     Also other studies show that those who abstain from animal products are in fact <a style="color: #7fcc2b" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4073139/">healthier</a>h and also tend to live longer. 
                     <br><br>
                    Many people assume that vegans don’t get enough protein, but that assumption probably comes from the fact that all the pictures when they think of a vegan is grass.
                     No, we don’t just eat greens. There are many <a style="color: #7fcc2b" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321474#_noHeaderPrefixedContent">protein sources</a> such as beans, tofu, seitan, etc. One serving of seitan has 21 grams of protein which is just 2 grams shy of a serving of a chicken breast! 
                     <br><br>
                    There are many vegan athletes that prove that you can still be strong, muscular, and healthy as a “protein deficient vegan”. One great example is the very Famous tennis player <a style="color: #7fcc2b" href="https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/athletes/detail/venus-williams/">Venus Williams</a>. 
                    This woman has been vegan since 2011 and has won 21 Gram Slam Titles throughout 2013. She is truly an inspiration.

            <h3 class="titleText">Zoos</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Oh yeah, zoos. A pretty place with lots of captive animals and snacks. A place that is made just to entertain people at the expense of other living creatures.
                 There are two claims that are heard that are in defense of zoos and why they are necessary:</p>
               <br><p> <ol style="color: white;">
                    <li>To educate </li>
                    <li>To protect endangered species</li>
                </ol></p>
           <br><br><br> <p>For the first point, do people actually believe that they will learn anything about animals while the animals are kept out of their natural habitats.
                 Most people go to the zoos just to spend time with family, which they can do pretty much anywhere else, and look at exotic animals just because why not.
                  There are documentaries that actually teach people something without putting the animals in cages that are hundreds of thousands of miles from their home. 
                <br><br>
                  For the second point, “in European zoos, 70-75 percent of animals are not threatened in the wild.
                 Of the approximately 850 mammal species and subspecies held in European zoos, 500 are assessed as of least concern on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list, and only 45 (5 percent) are critically endangered. 
                 Of those 45 critically endangered, we estimate as few as three are actually viable when taking into account the issues of hybridisation, disease and genetic diversity.”<a style="color: #7fcc2b" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/zoos-cruel-wildlife-conservation-species-a9056701.html">(Aspinall, 2019)</a>
                  Instead of putting an endangered species into zoos, they could be held in places that are at least a hundred times bigger than in the 6 by 6 cages they are kept in. Many animals that are kept in zoos go <a style="color: #7fcc2b"href="https://sites.psu.edu/siowfa14/2014/10/12/do-zoos-drive-animals-insane-2/">crazy</a>. 
                  Many try to <a style="color: #7fcc2b" href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2018/09/251_255788.html">run away</a>, but get shot as soon as they step out of the zoo. Those animals in zoos are just kept for our entertainment and nothing else. If they actually cared for them, the conditions wouldn’t be the ones the animals are currently held in.

               <br><br>
               Don’t even start with SeaWorld. Seaworld doesn’t even deserve its own category. It is just like a circus but with sea animals. 
               Such magnificent creatures kept and tortured in a POOL!? A POOL!? Ocean makes up 85% of the Earth’s surface, all that space for them to roam around.
                Yet people decide to put them in pools that aren’t even really big enough for them to truly swim.
                <br> To put it into perspective: they are living in a pool the same size as a neighborhood block for us humans. Imagine never being able to go anywhere further than your own one block.

It is also occasionally ineffective since humans are obviously different from rodents and other animals.
                 Just because it may be safe for them doesn’t mean it would be safe for us. I think it is obvious that with animal testing comes animal abuse. They are forced into possibly lethal experiments on the daily.
                  Nowadays we can just skip the animal testing part and go straight to human observations as the Covid-19 vaccine showed. We have enough information on what may or may not harm humans that doing animal testing is pretty much useless.

                 Here is a <a style="color: #7fcc2b" href="https://healabel.com/vegan-fabric-textile-material-list">list</a> of what is considered vegan clothing and what is not.</p>

                    <p>Wool? Huh? You can just shave it off right? No harm! That’s where you are going to be wrong. 
                        PETA has videos showing the abuse, but I don’t really trust or like PETA so let’s go with logic.
                         Do you really think an animal will stand still while being shaved? Dogs who are being shaved always have to be held down in some sort of way in order for them to stay still.
                          Sheeps have to be held down as well, but nobody is looking plus the workers had to have gone through a whole bunch of other sheeps so they are probably not as nice to them. 
                          For dogs they are being shaven for their own good, but with sheep they are being shaven for their wool. In one instance it does matter what happens to the animal and in the other it really doesn’t as long as it is somewhat alive to produce more wool in the future. </p>

            <h3 class="titleText">Do Plants Feel Pain?</h3>
            <p>The fact that this is even a question is just beyond me. At first I thought people said this only as a joke until I found out it is not always the case. 
                No, plants do not feel plain. "Given that plants do not have pain receptors, nerves, or a brain, they do not feel pain as we members of the animal kingdom understand it."<a style="color: #7fcc2b;" href="https://www.britannica.com/story/do-plants-feel-pain">(Petruzzello)</a>Even if they did, the animal industry feeds more plants to the animals than the humans do or even possibly can. They also have to overfeed them in order to get the most meat out of them.
                 So even if plants did feel pain, not eating animal products would still cause less harm.            </p>

            <h3 class="titleText">What about the kids in Africa?</h3>
            <p>Are you a kid in Africa? It is obviously understandable when the person is fighting for their life and eating animal products is the only way for them to survive. 
                They are a whole other story and it is understandable as to why they need to consume meat. That is vegans are okay with obligated carnivores like lions to eat meat, they have to eat meat in order to survive.
                 Vegans never target those people. Most people who bring up arguments similar to this are those who are 100% capable of going vegan but just don’t want to.             </p>
        </div>
<br><br>
        <div class="title">
            <h3 class="titleText">Any tips?</h3>
            <p>For those who are transitioning or thinking of transitioning, I’ve got some tips for you. I grew up eating all sorts of meats and dairy.
                 While most kids went straight to the dessert isle, I went to the meat aisle. It was no exaggeration to say that I loved meat.
                  So, I do understand how hard it is to switch to a vegan diet as a lifelong omnivore. What helps the most is remembering why you are doing what you are doing.</p>
                <br><ul style="color: white;">
                    <li>Is that burger really worth an innocent life while there is a good plant- based alternative?</li>
                        <li>Is that cheesecake worth it when in order for me to eat that a baby calf had to have been separated from their mother while, once again, there’s an amazing plant based option?</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
               <p>We have it really easy right now, there are so many plant based alternatives that cover all of the cravings you might have. I must admit some may not be the best and are not that close to the real thing, but they do the job. Honestly though, when you are eating the plant based version you feel no guilt because you are not eating something that has been made out of pain, so that makes up for its taste.
               ALso, I can’t stress enough how important a balanced diet is. It keeps you satiated and healthy. I know living off of oreos sounds like a dream, but also say hi to many health problems if you do decide to do that. Here is a guide if you are not sure where to start.
